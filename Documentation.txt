
============================
--Due to the late announcement I created two main methods in my project.

--The real main method that will run the program is within the "Main" class. 
please to run the program without errors go to the "Main" class and press left click to run 
the file from that class. 

--Then it will ask you to enter the path for the file to read from if you want to check 
the same file "input.txt" just press Enter and ignore that line. 

--If the program prints "go check the file" means everything is done and you can check the file "output.txt".
